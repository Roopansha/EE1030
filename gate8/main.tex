    \item A structural member of rectangular cross-section $10 \text{ mm} \times 6 \text{ mm}$ and length $1 \text{ m}$ is made of steel $\brak{\text{Young's modulus is } 200 \text{ GPa}}$ $\brak{\text{coefficient of thermal expansion is } 12 \times 10^{-6}/^{\circ}\text{C}}$. It is rigidly fixed at both ends and then subjected to a gradual increase in temperature. Ignoring the three-dimensional effects, the structural member will buckle if the temperature is increased by $\Delta T$ \degree C, which is

    \item A cantilevered beam is subjected to a parabolic distribution of shear traction at the right edge while the top and bottom surfaces are traction-free. To solve this problem, the following Airy's stress function is proposed: $\phi = C_1 xy + C_2 xy^3 + C_3 x^2 y^2 + C_4 x^3 y$. This is an admissible Airy's function that would satisfy the bi-harmonic equation as well as the boundary conditions if and only if
