    \item A cantilevered beam is subjected to a parabolic distribution of shear traction at the right edge while the top and bottom surfaces are traction-free. To solve this problem, the following Airy's stress function is proposed: $\phi = C_1 xy + C_2 xy^3 + C_3 x^2 y^2 + C_4 x^3 y$. This is an admissible Airy's function that would satisfy the bi-harmonic equation as well as the boundary conditions if and only if
